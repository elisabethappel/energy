# Building Energy Use in NYC

This repo contains [and visualises](https://github.com/elisabethappel/energy.git) data from New York City's annual benchmarking of energy use in large buildings. 

Building energy use accounts for nearly-two thirds of greenhouse gas emissions in New York City. The City's set of energy efficiency laws targets the largest existing buildings which constitute 45 percent of citywide energy use. Local Laws 84 and 33 specifically require buildings above 25,000 square feet to annually benchmark energy and water consumption, and to post an energy efficiency grade at each public entrance. Similar to the Department of Health grades for restaurants, a buildingâ€™s energy efficiency grade is a letter.
